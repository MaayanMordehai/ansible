- cfg-replica role - need to make sure the omit with notify handler works and not start the handler, if not change the role accurdingly :(
- rmt-pg-bck role - make sure delete works fast.
- deployment add check that primary_server in cluster_name group.
- add a 'must' column to the readmes parameters table to clearify which parameters the roles must get
- check if the parameters pg_admin_user, admin_user_pass and pg_db are needed in the play group vars or should be in the roles defaults/vars - if not needed in the group vars change and also change in the main readme

READMES:
- main - the plays readme
- main - maybe seperate the unmandtory parameters to section of possible overwrite, unlikly to require overwrite and don't overwrite - cause the plays might fail or get unexpectable resoult - write something about you must test the results properly.
